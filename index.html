        I likes so much the computer and I want to learned about developing systems and web designer in BYU because I always want to
        study there and having online study is the best way to start, I the past I took some classes about develop web site and I hope

        in this earth and trying to do our best is the best way to say "thanks for the opportunity", I have been member of the church
        for 10 years and is the best decision that ever I was taking because i know that God is alive and I know everything that is in
        the scripture is true, Gods always talking to the men that he wants to teach, He is teaching a guide my life every day.
